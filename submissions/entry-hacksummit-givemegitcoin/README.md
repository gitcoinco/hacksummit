_bit about me_
A fullstack developer who's a noob to blockchain, React.js etc. Just getting started.

### Purpose ###
Inspire coders to work on issues by making bet against themselves while others can also bet for or against the completion of the task under a set timer. I.e., if user A thinks she can fix an issue in 1 hour and willing to bet 0.1 ETH on that, and user B thinks she can not, and willing to bet 0.1 ETH against that, the end result is someone's getting more than they put down. (Unless there's nobody betting but one person which is still pretty motivating IMHO).

### WIP ###

__Done__
- [x] Use Remix and Solidity to create and deploy a smart contract.
- [x] Use React.js, npm, webpack to start local dev environment.
- [x] Connect frontend components to interact with the smart contract (see picture above).

__To Do__
- [ ] Implement time limit so user can set it for the bet on the fix.
- [ ] Implement betting for or against the completion of the stated fix in the set time.
- [ ] Implement prize distribution.
- [ ] How to verify the completion of the task.
